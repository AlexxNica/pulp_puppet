Pulp 2.2 Release Notes
======================

Pulp 2.2.0
==========

New Features
------------

For Puppet functionality, this is mostly a bug-fix release.

Many of the commands in the command line interface have improved. In particular,
many commands that used to display a task ID will now automatically poll the
server and display progress until it is complete.

A technical reference has been added for Puppet support, which is available at
`<http://www.pulpproject.org/docs/>`_

Upgrade Instructions
--------------------

Please see the
`Pulp Platform upgrade instructions <https://docs.pulpproject.org/en/latest/user-guide/release-notes/2.2.x.html>`_
to upgrade the Pulp and Puppet RPMs and database.
