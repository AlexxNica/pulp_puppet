Pulp Puppet 2.13.0
==================

New Features
------------

- Added the ``subdir`` option to the install distributor. This is an optional setting to install
  puppet modules in a subdirectory in the ``install_path``. This allows Pulp to install puppet
  modules in ``install_path[/subdir]`` and to remove the ``install_path`` directory on distributor
  removal. If the specified ``subdir`` does not exist it will be created.
