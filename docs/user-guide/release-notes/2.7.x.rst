Pulp Puppet 2.7 Release Notes

=================

New Features
------------

- Support for using the Puppet Forge v3 API for installing modules
- The :ref:`install-distributor` removes the environment directory on repo delete

API Changes
-----------

- The `unit_key` parameter is ignored by the API when uploading puppet modules. The unit key is
  always determined through inspection of metadata.json in the top level directory. The parameter
  `unit key` is still required by the Pulp platform, but its value is ignored for Puppet content.
